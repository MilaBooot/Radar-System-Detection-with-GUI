# Radar-System-Detection-with-GUI
Radars send out electromagnetic waves similar to wireless computer networks and mobile phones. The signals are sent out as short pulses which may be reflected by objects in their path, in part reflecting back to the radar. In that same way, the pulse reflects off precipitation and sends a signal back to the radar.
