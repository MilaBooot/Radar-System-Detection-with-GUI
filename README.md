## What Is Radar?
RADAR stands for RAdio Detecting And Ranging and as indicated by the name, it is based on the use of radio waves. Radars send out electromagnetic waves similar to wireless computer networks and mobile phones. The signals are sent out as short pulses which may be reflected by objects in their path, in part reflecting back to the radar. When these pulses intercept precipitation, part of the energy is scattered back to the radar. This concept is similar to hearing an echo. For example, when you shout into a well, the sound waves of your shout reflect off the water and back up to you. In that same way, the pulse reflects off precipitation and sends a signal back to the radar. From this information the radar is able to tell where the precipitation is occurring and how much precipitation exists.

## Components Of The Radar
Radars in their basic form have four main components:

A transmitter, which creates the energy pulse.
A transmit/receive switch that tells the antenna when to transmit and when to receive the pulses.
An antenna to send these pulses out into the atmosphere and receive the reflected pulse back.
A receiver, which detects, amplifies and transforms the received signals into video format.
# How It Works
First Download Arduino IDE and Processing IDE (processing-3.5.4) this will be used to Make a Graphical User interface for radar system
after that open arduino Ide and copy and pase the arduion code(radar_pro) using arduino type u have and Run it
then that open processing Ide(sketch_210605a) and copy and pase the GUI radar code and Run it
the servo motor and ultrasoic sensor start working and all setup works
REMEMBER- the code must be in the same directory but different foldersssssssssssssssss
